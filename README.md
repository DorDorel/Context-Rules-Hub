# 🧠 Context & Rules Hub

A centralized repository for managing System Prompts, Rules, and Context for AI coding assistants (Cursor, Gemini, Copilot, OpenCode, etc.).

Instead of manually configuring `.cursorrules` or `AGENTS.md` for every new project, this repository acts as a **Single Source of Truth**. With one command, you can inject the latest rules into any project.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each technology stack has its own dedicated folder containing markdown rule files.

```text
.
├── sync_agents.py           # 🚀 The CLI script that orchestrates everything
├── swiftui_rules/           # Rules for iOS/macOS development
│   └── core.md
├── nestjs_rules/            # Rules for Backend/NestJS
│   └── core.md
├── flutter_rules/           # Rules for Flutter
│   ├── core.md
│   └── rules.strict.md      # Merged automatically with core.md
├── cloud_functions/         # Rules for Serverless/Firebase
│   └── core.md
└── mcp/                     # Rules for Model Context Protocol
    └── opencode.md
```

## ⚡️ Quick Setup (The Alias)

To use this tool from anywhere in your terminal, set up a permanent alias.

1. **Clone this repository** to a permanent location (e.g., `~/dev/ai-rules`).
2. **Edit your shell configuration** (`.zshrc` or `.bashrc`):
   ```bash
   nano ~/.zshrc
   ```
3. **Add the following line** (update the path to where you cloned this repo):
   ```bash
   alias rules-sync='python3 ~/dev/ai-rules/sync_agents.py'
   ```
4. **Refresh your terminal**:
   ```bash
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

## 🚀 Usage

Navigate to any project folder on your machine and run the sync command with your desired stack.

### Syntax

```bash
rules-sync <stack_name>
```

### Examples

**For a SwiftUI Project:**

```bash
cd ~/my-apps/awesome-ios-app
rules-sync swiftui
```

**For a Flutter Project:**

```bash
cd ~/my-apps/cross-platform-app
rules-sync flutter
```

_(Note: This will combine both `core.md` and `rules.strict.md` from the flutter folder)_

**For a NestJS Project:**

```bash
rules-sync nest
```

## 🛠️ Generated Files

The script automatically generates/updates the following configuration files in your project root:

| File                              | Target Tool            |
| :-------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| `.cursorrules`                    | Cursor (Project Rules) |
| `.agent/AGENTS.md`                | Google Antigravity     |
| `GEMINI.md`                       | Gemini CLI             |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot         |
| `.opencode/AGENTS.md`             | OpenCode (Local)       |
| `AGENTS.md`                       | Codex / General        |

## ➕ Adding New Stacks

To add a new technology stack (e.g., Python):

1. **Create a new folder**: `python_rules`.
2. **Add a `core.md` file** inside with your instructions.
3. **(Optional)** If the folder name doesn't match the command exactly, update the `TECH_MAP` in `sync_agents.py`.

> **Note:** All generated files include a signature: `> Auto-generated by sync_agents.py.`
